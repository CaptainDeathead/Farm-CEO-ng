## Description
Farm CEO is a farm management game designed to be as realistic as possible, while giving you a full game packed of farming fun.

## How to play
### Paddock states
Every paddock has its own state. This is shown by the paddock's colour.
Here is a breakdown of each state / colour:
 - Harvested (Brown): The paddock has been harvested and requires to be cultivated ready to be sown again for another year.
 - Tilled (Grey): The paddock has been cultivated and is ready to be seeded with a crop type of your choice.
 - Growth 1 (Light green): The paddock has just been seeded.
 - Growth 2 (Green): The paddock's crops have grown and require fertilisers.
 - Growth 3 (Darker green): The crop has grown to the maximum height vehicles can drive through and so it is the final stage that fertilisers and chemicals can be applied. It is highly advised you spray herbicide on your crops in this stage.
 - Growth 4 (Dark green): The crop is very tall now and needs to dry out. Nothing can be done in this state as the crops are too big for a vehicle to drive through.
 - Ready to harvest (Yellow): The paddock is ready to be harvested where you can collect the grain and sell it when the price is right. The cycle then repeats.

### Paddock indicators
There are symbols around the center of each paddock.
These symbols pop up when the game is communicating different events in each paddock (Check the guide for more info).

### Contracts
Contracts are recommended to do in the background while you work on other things. This gives you a second form of income while your crops are growing.
Each contract has a reward as well as a fail cost. The contracts also show what material is required for completion.

For example: If a paddock requires seeding it will tell you what seeds to plant in the "Material" text in the contracts menu.

If a contract is not completed in the same day it will fail.
If a contract is completed incorrectly it will fail.

On fail you will be charged with the associated fail cost.

### Grain menu
The grain menu shows a table containing all of the crop prices. It is recommended to sell crops when they are at their best prices.
When you first play the game it is recommended that you don't sell your crops, but keep an eye out on the grain prices for each crop type to see weather the prices are good or bad.

The base prices for each crop type are as follows:
```
Wheat: $300
Barley: $400
Oat: $800
Canola: $600
```

The maximum possible price for each crop to sell at is 15% above the base price.

### General info
You need to buy a paddock before you can work in it (unless there is an active contract for that paddock).
Paddocks can be bought through the shop.
Paddock numbers will be blue if owned.

Paddock numbers will be orange if a contract is active for it.

Sleeping advances to the next day, which also advances all growth stages.
To sleep, press on the shed (the blue rectangle in the middle of the map).

### Assigning tasks
To assign a vehicle to perform a task you must be in the equipment menu.
Vehicles are green buttons and tools are purple.

To assign a task, press on a vehicle button.
If the selected vehicle is a header you can select the destination and it will go.
If the selected vehicle is a tractor you will be prompted to select a tool before selecting the destination.

Destinations will only be available for specific tools.
You cannot assign multiple vehicles to the same paddock UNLESS the selected tool is a trailer.

Trailers can be used to unload headers and fill up empty tools.
If a header parks up in a paddock with it's pipe out it needs to be unloaded with a trailer.
If a tool parks up in the paddock it needs to be loaded up with a trailer.

To unload a header simply assign a tractor with a trailer to go to the paddock with the header that requires unloading.
To load a tool, assign a tractor with a trailer to go to the paddock with the waiting tractor and tool that requires loading. The material will be automatically selected based off of whats already in the tool.

### Selling crops
To sell crop assign a tractor with a trailer to go to the desired sell point.
In other words, when choosing a destination for a tractor and trailer, select the silo on the map that has the same name as the sell point you want to sell your crops at because it is the sell point.
You will then be prompted to select a crop type, select the desired crop type.

The vehicle and trailer should then go to the sell point and sell the crops.
